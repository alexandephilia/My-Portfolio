  <div class="translate-x-12 rotate-y-90 bg-sky-300/75 ...">3</div>
  <div class="-translate-x-12 -rotate-y-90 bg-sky-300/75 ...">4</div>
  <div class="-translate-y-12 rotate-x-90 bg-sky-300/75 ...">5</div>
  <div class="translate-y-12 -rotate-x-90 bg-sky-300/75 ...">6</div>
</div>
<div class="size-20 transform-3d ...">
  <div class="translate-z-12 rotate-x-0 bg-sky-300/75 ...">1</div>
  <div class="-translate-z-12 rotate-y-18 bg-sky-300/75 ...">2</div>
  <div class="translate-x-12 rotate-y-90 bg-sky-300/75 ...">3</div>
  <div class="-translate-x-12 -rotate-y-90 bg-sky-300/75 ...">4</div>
  <div class="-translate-y-12 rotate-x-90 bg-sky-300/75 ...">5</div>

Source: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/visibility

This example illustrates the use of the `collapse` utility class in Tailwind CSS for hiding table rows or columns. It effectively hides the element as if `display: none` was applied, but without impacting the size or layout of other rows and columns in the table, enabling dynamic toggling without layout shifts.

```html
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Invoice #</th>
      <th>Client</th>
      <th>Amount</th>
    </tr>

```html
<blockquote
  class="text-center text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 italic dark:text-white"
>
  When you look
  <span
    class="relative inline-block before:absolute before:-inset-1 before:block before:-skew-y-3 before:bg-pink-500"
  >
    <span class="relative text-white dark:text-gray-950">annoyed</span>
  </span>
  all the time, people think that you're busy.
</blockquote>

@media (hover: hover) {
  .hover\:underline:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
  }
}
```

```css
@custom-variant hover (&:hover);
```

Source: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states

This example demonstrates how to style child elements based on the state of their parent. By applying the `group` class to the parent, child elements can use `group-*` variants (e.g., `group-hover`, `group-focus`) to react to the parent's state changes.

```html
<a href="#" class="group ...">
  <div>
    <svg
      class="stroke-sky-500 group-hover:stroke-white ..."
      fill="none"
      viewBox="0 0 24 24"
    >
      <!-- ... -->
    </svg>
    <h3 class="text-gray-900 group-hover:text-white ...">New project</h3>
  </div>
  <p class="text-gray-500 group-hover:text-white ...">
    Create a new project from a variety of starting templates.
  </p></a
>
```

```html
<p class="whitespace-break-spaces">
  Hey everyone!It's almost 2022 and we still don't know if there are aliens
  living among us, or do we? Maybe the person writing this is an alien.You will
  never know.

This example illustrates how to use the `odd` and `even` pseudo-class variants in Tailwind CSS to apply alternating background colors to table rows. This enhances readability by visually distinguishing rows in a table, here demonstrated with a list of people's names, titles, and emails.

```html
<table>
  <!-- ... -->
  <tbody>
    {#each people as person}
    <!-- Use different background colors for odd and even rows -->
    <tr
      class="odd:bg-white even:bg-gray-50 dark:odd:bg-gray-900/50 dark:even:bg-gray-950"
    >
      <td>{person.name}</td>
      <td>{person.title}</td>
      <td>{person.email}</td>
    </tr>
    {/each}
  </tbody>
</table>

### Use native CSS variables in Tailwind

Source: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/compatibility

Modern browsers support native CSS variables without preprocessor tools. Tailwind relies heavily on CSS variables internally, allowing you to use var() syntax for dynamic styling with predefined custom properties.

```css
.typography {
  font-size: var(--text-base);
  color: var(--color-gray-700);
}
```

### Resolve Multiple Value Types with Single `--value()` in Tailwind CSS

Source: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles

This example shows that the `--value()` function in Tailwind CSS can accept multiple arguments to resolve theme, bare, and arbitrary values in a left-to-right order. This simplifies utility definitions when no special handling is needed for different types, as seen with `tab-size` and `opacity` utilities.

```css
@theme {
  --tab-size-github: 8;
}
@utility tab-* {
  tab-size: --value(--tab-size-*, integer, [integer]);
}
@utility opacity-* {
  opacity: calc(--value(integer) * 1%);
  opacity: --value(--opacity-*, [percentage]);
}
```

### Update placeholder color styling in Tailwind CSS v4 Preflight

Source: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide

In v4, placeholder text uses current text color at 50% opacity instead of gray-400. Add this CSS to your base layer to preserve v3 behavior with the gray-400 color for input and textarea placeholders.

```css
@layer base {
  input::placeholder,
  textarea::placeholder {
    color: var(--color-gray-400);
  }
}
```

Responsive variants like md: can be used to apply utilities at specific breakpoints.

```html
<div
  class="mask-clip-border border-3 p-1.5 mask-[url(/img/circle.png)] bg-[url(/img/mountains.jpg)] ..."
></div>
<div
  class="mask-clip-padding border-3 p-1.5 mask-[url(/img/circle.png)] bg-[url(/img/mountains.jpg)] ..."

### Apply Border Start Color with Tailwind CSS Utility Classes

Source: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/border-color

These Tailwind CSS utility classes are used to set the `border-inline-start-color` property, which defines the color of the logical inline-start border of an element. Each class maps to a specific color and shade, utilizing CSS custom properties (variables) like `--color-cyan-700` for consistent theming. The classes follow the `border-s-{color}-{shade}` naming convention.

```css
border-inline-start-color: var(--color-cyan-700); /* oklch(52% 0.105 223.128) */
```

```css
border-inline-start-color: var(--color-cyan-800); /* oklch(45% 0.085 224.283) */

### Using @apply and Theme Variables in Vue/Svelte/CSS Modules with Tailwind CSS v4

Source: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide

Stylesheets bundled separately (e.g., Vue `<style>` blocks, Svelte, CSS modules) in Tailwind CSS v4 do not automatically access global theme variables or custom utilities. This snippet provides two solutions: using `@reference` to import definitions without duplicating CSS, or directly applying CSS theme variables for improved performance and simpler styling.

```vue
<template><h1>Hello world!</h1></template>
<style>
@reference "../../app.css";
h1 {
  @apply text-2xl font-bold text-red-500;
}
</style>
```

```vue
<template><h1>Hello world!</h1></template>
<style>
h1 {
  color: var(--text-red-500);
}
</style>
```

border-inline-start-color: var(--color-red-100); /* oklch(93.6% 0.032 17.717) */

/* border-s-red-200 */
border-inline-start-color: var(--color-red-200); /* oklch(88.5% 0.062 18.334) */

/* border-s-red-300 */
border-inline-start-color: var(--color-red-300); /* oklch(80.8% 0.114 19.571) */

/* border-s-red-400 */
border-inline-start-color: var(--color-red-400); /* oklch(70.4% 0.191 22.216) */

### Alternative to Tailwind CSS ::before Pseudo-element with a Span

Source: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states

This HTML snippet provides an alternative to using the `::before` pseudo-element for decorative styling by employing a regular `<span>` element. It achieves the same visual effect (a skewed background) as the pseudo-element example but is often considered more readable and simpler to implement, especially when the content is not purely decorative.

```html
<blockquote class="text-center text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 italic">
  When you look
  <span class="relative">
    <span
      class="absolute -inset-1 block -skew-y-3 bg-pink-500"
      aria-hidden="true"
    ></span>
    <span class="relative text-white">annoyed</span>
  </span>
  all the time, people think that you're busy.
</blockquote>
```

### Control Element Flow with Block and Inline Display in HTML/CSS

Source: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/display

This snippet demonstrates how to use Tailwind CSS's `inline`, `inline-block`, and `block` utilities to control the flow of text and elements within a document. These utilities directly map to the CSS `display` property, affecting how elements wrap and occupy space. The example shows how `inline` allows text to wrap normally, `inline-block` wraps the element to prevent overflow, and `block` places the element on its own line.

```html
<p>
  When controlling the flow of text, using the CSS property
  <span class="inline">display: inline</span> will cause the text inside the
  element to wrap normally.
</p>
<p>
  While using the property
  <span class="inline-block">display: inline-block</span> will wrap the element
  to prevent the text inside from extending beyond its parent.
</p>
<p>
  Lastly, using the property <span class="block">display: block</span> will put
  the element on its own line and fill its parent.
</p>
```

### Tailwind CSS `*` Variant Override Limitation Example

Source: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states

This snippet highlights a limitation when using the `*` variant: styles applied from a parent using `*` cannot be overridden by utility classes directly on the child element. This is due to the order of CSS rule generation and specificity, where child rules are generated after parent rules with the same specificity.

```html
<ul class="*:bg-sky-50 ...">
  <li class="bg-red-50 ...">Sales</li>
  <li>Marketing</li>
  <li>SEO</li>
  <!-- ... -->
</ul>

### Incorrect Tailwind CSS peer Usage: Styling Non-Previous Siblings

Source: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states

This example illustrates an incorrect usage of the Tailwind CSS `peer` variant. The `peer` class must be applied to a _previous_ sibling for the `peer-*` variants to work correctly due to CSS subsequent-sibling combinator limitations. Here, `peer-invalid:text-red-500` is applied to a `<span>` that is not a subsequent sibling of the `input` with `peer`.

```html
<label>
  <span class="peer-invalid:text-red-500 ...">Email</span>
  <input type="email" class="peer ..."
/></label>
```

### Tailwind CSS Text Shadow Color Utility Class Examples

Source: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/text-shadow

This snippet illustrates the pattern of Tailwind CSS utility classes for setting text shadow colors. Each class, following the `text-shadow-[color]-[shade]` convention, translates into a CSS custom property `--tw-text-shadow-color` that references a specific color variable from the Tailwind theme. This mechanism allows for easy and consistent application of text shadow colors across a project.

```css
--tw-text-shadow-color var(--color-yellow-100);
```

```css
--tw-text-shadow-color var(--color-lime-500);
```

```css
--tw-text-shadow-color var(--color-green-950);

<div class="max-w-sm md:max-w-lg ..."><!-- ... --></div>
```

---

### Apply Border Colors with Tailwind CSS Utilities

Source: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/border-color

These examples illustrate how Tailwind CSS utility classes are used to set the `border-color` property. Each utility class, such as `border-sky-300` or `border-blue-500`, maps to a specific CSS custom property (`--color-sky-300`, `--color-blue-500`) which defines the border color. The comments indicate the Oklch color space values for each shade.

```css
border-color: var(--color-sky-300); /* oklch(82.8% 0.111 230.318) */
```

```css
border-color: var(--color-sky-400); /* oklch(74.6% 0.16 232.661) */
```

```css
border-color: var(--color-sky-500); /* oklch(68.5% 0.169 237.323) */
```

```css
border-color: var(--color-sky-600); /* oklch(58.8% 0.158 241.966) */
```

```css
border-color: var(--color-sky-700); /* oklch(50% 0.134 242.749) */
```

```css
border-color: var(--color-sky-800); /* oklch(44.3% 0.11 240.79) */

```css
.my-class {
  background-color: var(--color-red-500);
}
```

```css
@media (width >= theme(--breakpoint-xl)) {
  /* ... */

```css
@import "tailwindcss" prefix(tw);
```

```css
@layer theme {
  :root {
    --tw-color-red-500: oklch(0.637 0.237 25.331);

```html
<div class="box-border size-32 border-4 p-4 ..."><!-- ... --></div>
```
